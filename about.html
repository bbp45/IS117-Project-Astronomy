<p>My name is Barkha Patel. I am a senior at New Jersey Institute of Technology.
    I am majoring in Information Technology and specializing in Web Applications.
    I have many hobbies. One of them is Astronomy. Even though I got into Astronomy
    in 2018, I have always been fascinated by it since I was probably three or four
    years old. Whenever I think about what got me into Astronomy, I think about the
    time when I was living in a small village in India, where at the time, there were
    not as many street-lights. So, one night my aunt, my cousins, my sisters, and I were
    sitting outside, and I noticed the moon, how it was like a huge light bulb in the
    sky. It was a full moon night, and it was right overhead, lighting up the entire village
    at night. Since then, I have been very fascinated by the world outside of Earth. Mostly, I
    have learned about our universe through documentaries, and YouTube videos. However, I have
    taken an Astronomy class at New Jersey Institute of Technology as an elective, which was an
    amazing as well as incredibly informative class.
