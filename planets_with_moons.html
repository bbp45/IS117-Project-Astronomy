    <h2>Jupiter's Moons</h2>

    <br>

    <p>
        There are total eight planets: four rocky and four gas giants.
        Few of these planets have their own moons orbiting around them.
        One of the planets is Jupiter. It is one of gas giants.
        It has total of eighty moons. Out of eighty, four of these moons,
        Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, were the first ones to be discovered.
        They are called Galilean moons, because Galileo Galilei was the first to
        observe them in the early seventeenth century. Not just out of all eighty
        moons, but also in the entire solar system, Ganymede is the largest moon
        measuring 3,270 miles in diameter. Next, Europa is a moon known to have frozen
        water surface above a saltwater ocean. There is a possibility that it might be
        able to support life. Callisto is another moon with an icy surface. It also is
        Jupiter's second-largest moon as well as the third-largest moon overall in the
        solar system. Io is the only place in the solar system with the most amount of
        active volcanoes.
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <h2>Saturn's Moons</h2>

    <br>

    <p>
        Furthermore, another gas giant with moons is Saturn. It is
        known to have over sixty moons. The largest moon of Saturn is Titan measuring
        3200 miles in diameter. It is also the second-largest moon in the solar system.
        It is the only moon, which consists of atmosphere, liquid lakes, and clouds. All
        the other moons of Saturn are relatively smaller.
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <h2>Earth's Moon</h2>

    <br>

    <p>
        Finally, the Earth, one of the rocky terrestrial planets, has one moon.
        During the early formation of the solar system, around 4.5 billion years
        ago, a mars-sized planet called Theia crashed into the Earth. The debris
        orbiting the Earth slowly formed into the Moon we know today. It plays an
        essential role in balancing the tides, the cycles, etc. Since, only one
        side of moon is facing towards Earth, the other side is always hidden
        away from us when we are looking at it from Earth. It is believed that Moon
        is drifting away from Earth each year by few centimeters, since the last 2.5
        billion years.
